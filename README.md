# Task-2-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-

ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
The goal of this task is to explore and understand the Titanic dataset using descriptive statistics and data visualizations. This helps reveal important patterns, relationships, and anomalies in the data before applying any machine learning models.

 Steps Performed:
1. Synopsis of Statistics
produced quartiles, mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, and other fundamental statistics.

To obtain a comprehensive overview of the categorical and numeric columns, utilize describe().

aided in locating anomalous values, skewed distributions, and missing values.

2. Histograms
To see the distribution of values, plotted histograms for each numerical feature.

allowed for the detection of distribution shape (e.g., normal, bimodal) and skewness.

3. Boxplots
To see outliers and spread, boxplots were made for every numerical feature.

Columns with extreme values, such as Fare, were quickly identified.

4. The matrix of correlation
calculated correlation between numerical variables on a pairwise basis.

To find strong or weak linear relationships (such as Pclass vs. Fare or Age vs. Survived), a heatmap was plotted using Seaborn.

5. The pairplot
created a pairplot of chosen features using scatter plots and histograms:

Pclass, Age, Fare, and SurvivedÂ Utilized
